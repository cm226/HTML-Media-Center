This is a HTML media center project

the home page can be found by going to HOST/HTML-Media-Center/


the jqueery player used for music section was obtained from http://www.codebasehero.com

some initial setup of directourys is required to run the project.
in the directory HTML-Media-Center/Desktop/scripts there is a file named setupFolders.py and another named symbolicLinks.xml

You should open the symbolicLinks file and fill it with the locations where you want each media type to be stored (replace defaults). 

run the serupFolders Script after filling out the symbolic links

create your mysql database with the script inside Desktop/db/Database.sql

then inside Desktop/congig/config.php (only avalable after setupFolders.py has been run) and fill it out with your database information

Then you should be good to go :)
