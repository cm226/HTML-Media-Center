This is a HTML media center project

the home page can be found by going to HOST/HTML-Media-Center/


the jqueery player used for music section was obtained from http://www.codebasehero.com

some initial setup of directourys is required to run the project.
in the directory HTML-Media-Center/Desktop/scripts there is a file named setupFolders.py and another named symbolicLinks.xml

You should open the symbolicLinks file and fill it with the locations where you want each media type to be stored (replace defaults). 

run the serupFolders Script after filling out the symbolic links

create your mysql database with the script inside Desktop/db/Database.sql

then inside Desktop/congig/config.php (only avalable after setupFolders.py has been run) and fill it out with your database information

Then you should be good to go :)
 
 
 ToDo 
 
extract each core module into seperate dlls

update the mobile and desktop sites to use the same controllers and models 
	problems to solve on this
		different css and js inclusion (currently being handled)
		different template class intansiation based on url requested		
	
update the agent and serverside python scripts to allow for DHCP (its set on a static ip od 192.168.0.198 for debuging)
	- part wat completed but the server C++ needs to be updated to get the correct IP of itself its set right now at 162.168.0.199
	
unit test project for the main cpp .exe

create a remote control page for pauseing, changing volume fastforwardung and so on of playing things



Bugs

try accessing the url 
http://localhost/HTML-Media-Center/Mobile/Plugin/mobilePluginPage/Database%20Interface%20Generator$
the backend C++ crashed for some reason

This problem seems to be for all urls now and unit tests pass for the Comms core modules. 

not sure but the php seems to stop appending to the message buffer in the transever or the socket buffer is full on messages over 2427 bytes in length (unconfirmed on windows)
